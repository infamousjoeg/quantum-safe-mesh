# Government & Defense: Post-Quantum Security Implementation

## 🏛️ Sector Overview

Government and defense organizations face the highest stakes in the quantum era, protecting classified information, national security communications, and critical infrastructure that underpins society.

## 🚨 National Security Quantum Threat Assessment

### Critical Assets at Risk
- **Classified Communications**: Diplomatic cables, intelligence reports, military communications
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Power grids, transportation systems, telecommunications networks
- **Citizen Data**: Social security, tax records, healthcare, voting systems
- **Defense Systems**: Weapons systems, satellite communications, command and control
- **Intelligence Operations**: Source protection, surveillance data, counterintelligence

### Quantum Espionage Timeline
```
National Security Quantum Threat:
├── 2025-2027: State-sponsored quantum data harvesting programs active
├── 2028-2030: Nation-state quantum computing capabilities accelerating
├── 2030-2035: First quantum-enabled cyberattacks on national infrastructure
├── 2035-2040: Widespread quantum espionage capabilities
└── 2040+: Quantum warfare and complete legacy cryptography obsolescence
```

### Classification Level Impact Analysis
```
Security Classification vs Quantum Risk:
├── TOP SECRET: Immediate PQC required (ongoing harvest threat)
├── SECRET: PQC within 2 years (high-value target)
├── CONFIDENTIAL: PQC within 5 years (systematic collection risk)
├── FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY: PQC within 7 years (mass collection threat)
└── UNCLASSIFIED: Standard timeline (10+ years)
```
